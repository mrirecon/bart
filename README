2. Installation
===============

2.1. Prerequisites
------------------

GCC compiler, the FFTW library, and optionally CUDA.
(see recon/Makefile to turn options on or off)

The software can be used in combination with Matlab or octave.


There is limited support for reading Cartesian data encoded with
the ISMRM Raw Data format when linking with the ISMRMRD library
(http://ismrmrd.sourceforge.net/).


In the following, the symbol '`$`' indicates a shell prompt.
Do not type '`$`' when entering commands.



### 2.1.1. Linux

The software tools in recon should run on any recent Linux distribution.

To install the required libraries on Debian and Ubuntu run:

    $ sudo apt-get install gcc make libfftw3-dev liblapacke-dev libpng-dev libopenblas-dev

    (optional)
    $ sudo apt-get install octave

    (optional)
    install version 0.5.2 of the ISMRMRD library



### 2.1.2. Mac OS X

Xcode is required and it is recommended to install a newer version 
of gcc (4.7 seems to work) from MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).


    $ sudo port install fftw-3-single
    $ sudo port install gcc47
    $ sudo port install libpng
    $ sudo port install openblas

    (optional)
    $ sudo port install octave

    (optional)
    install version 0.5.2 of the ISMRMRD library



### 2.1.3. Windows

You can use BART on Windows using Cygwin:

https://www.cygwin.com/

Install Cygwin and select the following packages:

    Devel: gcc, make
    Math: fftw3, fftw3-doc, libfftw3-devel, libfftw3_3
    Math: liblapack-devel, liblapack-doc, liblapack0
    Libs: libpng, libpng-devel


Then use the cygwin shell to compile BART as described below.


(An alternative to using Cygwin is a virtual machine with Linux.)



2.2. Downloading and Compilation
--------------------------------

If you are a git user, you can simply clone our public repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mrirecon/bart


Otherwise, please download the latest version as a zip file
from Github:

	http://github.com/mrirecon/bart/releases/latest

and unpack it somewhere on your computer.


Open a terminal window and enter the bart directory (the top-level
directory with the Makefile in it). To build the reconstruction
tools type:

    $ make



If you have installed the ISMRMRD library version 0.5.2, you can also
build the ISMRM raw data import tool:

    $ make ismrmrd

### 2.3.2. Terminal

When using the toolbox commands from a UNIX shell, it is recommended
to set the TOOLBOX_PATH to the base directory and to add it to
the PATH variable. You can do this by running the following command:

    $ . startup.sh

Note: The dot or 'source' command is needed so that the variables
are imported into the current shell.


### 2.3.3. Matlab

You can set the TOOLBOX_PATH to the base directory and to add it
to the Matlab path by running the following command in the
bart directory:

    >> startup

(Note: The '>>' indicates the shell prompt. Do not type '>>'
when entering commands.)



You can use Matlab to read and visualize/process files. To write
a data file 'xyz' from Matlab you can run:

    >> writecfl('xyz', A);


Note, that the name 'xyz' is used without filename extension.
See below for more information about the file format used in BART.

To read the data file 'xyz' back into Matlab use:

    >> A = readcfl('xyz');


To call a BART tool (e.g. ecalib) from Matlab, you can use the
'bart' command:

    >> sensitivities = bart('ecalib', kspace);



Download and unpack the examples which demonstrate interoperability
with Matlab. Go to the examples directory and run:

    >> examples


### 2.3.4. Python

You can set the TOOLBOX_PATH to the base directory and start a
Python interactively as follows:

    $ python -i startup.py

You can use Python to read and visualize/process files. To write
a data file 'xyz' from Python you can run:

    >>> cfl.writecfl('xyz', A);

Note, that the name 'xyz' is used without filename extension.
See below for more information about the file format used in BART.

To read the data file 'xyz' back into Python use:

    >>> A = cfl.readcfl('xyz');

To call a BART tool (e.g. ecalib) from Python, you can use the
'bart' command:

    >>> sensitivities = bart(1, 'ecalib', kspace);

The bart function expects the following signature:

    >>> <outputs> = bart(<nargout>, <command>, <arguments>, ...)

To use BART in a script, please follow the steps in the
startup.py file.


3. Data Format
==============

3.1. Generic
------------

The input and output datasets are each stored in a pair of files: one
header (*.hdr) and one raw data (*.cfl). The header is a simple text
readable file that describes the dimensions of the data. The raw data
file is a binary file containing a single contiguous block of array
data of dimensions described in the header stored in column-major order
(first index is sequential). The raw data file is complex float 
(32 bit real + 32 bit imaginary, IEEE 747 binary32 little-endian).

Convenience methods to read and write our data files using Matlab may
be found in the matlab/ directory (readcfl.m and writecfl.m). Similar
methods for Python may be found in the python/ directory (cfl.py).



3.2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data
------------------------------------

For MRI data and images, the dimensions are usually assigned in
the following order:

    0 readout
    1 phase-encoding dimension 1
    2 phase-encoding dimension 2
    3 receive channels
    4 ESPIRiT maps
    ...
    ...

    (more dimensions are defined in src/misc/mri.h)


Undersampled data is stored with zeros in the unsampled
positions.



3.3. Non-Cartesian Trajectories and Samples
-------------------------------------------

The k-space coordinates for each sample are stored along dimension 0
which must have size equal to three. The unit of measurement is 1/FOV.
Dimension 1 stores the samples along a single readout windows while
dimension 2 may be used to differentiate between different lines
(e.g. radial spokes). Channel (3) and map (4) dimensions must not
be used (i.e. have size one), while other dimensions can be used
as for Cartesian data. Non-Cartesian samples are stored in a similar
way as trajectories except that dimension 0 is not used. The channel
dimension can be used for different receiver coils as usual.




4. Command-line Tools
=====================

All tools operate on the simple file format given above. Indices and
dimensions run from 0 to N-1. Sometimes a set of dimensions is given
as a bitmask where the lowest bit corresponds to the 0st dimension.


For example, an inverse Fourier transform of first three dimensions can
be performed with the following command:


    $ bart fft -i 7 kspace volume


More information about each command can be found in 'doc/commands.txt'.
