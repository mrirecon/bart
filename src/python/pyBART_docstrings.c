	"----------------------------\n"
	"Documentation is available through docstrings provided with the\n"
	"code.\n"
	"\n"
	"Use the built-in ``help`` function to view a function's docstring::\n"
	"\n"
	"  >>> help(pyBART.bart)\n"

	"The docstring examples assume that `numpy` has been imported as `np`::\n"

	"locations on disk (from regular CFL files).\n"
