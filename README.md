The Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) is a free and
open-source image-reconstruction framework for Computational 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The tools in this software implement
various reconstruction algorithms for Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
The software is intended for research use only and
NOT FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE. It comes without any warranty
